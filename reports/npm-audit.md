# NPM Dependency Audit

## Summary
- `npm audit` failed because the repository does not contain a `package-lock.json` or `npm-shrinkwrap.json` file.
- The absence of a lockfile indicates that no Node.js package manifest exists in the project root, so there are no npm-managed dependencies to audit.

## Recommendations
1. If the project intentionally omits Node.js dependencies, no action is required.
2. If Node.js tooling is expected:
   - Add a `package.json` and commit the dependency graph.
   - Run `npm install --package-lock-only` to generate a lockfile before auditing.
   - Re-run `npm audit` after the lockfile exists to capture known vulnerabilities.

## Command Output
See the command transcript for the exact error emitted by `npm audit` when no lockfile is present.
