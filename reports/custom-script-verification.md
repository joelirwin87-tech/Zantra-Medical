# Custom NPM Script Verification

## Summary
- Repository scanned on $(date -u).
- No `package.json` files were detected in the project tree, so there are no NPM scripts to execute.

## Discovery Steps
1. Ran `find . -name package.json` from the repository root to locate Node.js project manifests.
2. Confirmed that the command returned no results, indicating the absence of any `package.json`.

## Outcome
Because the project does not contain a `package.json`, there are no custom NPM scripts (including `start`, `dev`, `deploy`, or other lifecycle commands) to run. As a result, no script execution logs are available, and no hidden dependencies could be evaluated.

## Recommendations
- If Node.js tooling is expected, add the appropriate `package.json` with defined scripts.
- Otherwise, no further action is necessary for NPM script verification.
